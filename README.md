# Neural Network from Scratch (No External Libraries)

## Overview

This project implements a fully customizable neural network from scratch using NumPy. It provides an in-depth understanding of fundamental neural network operations, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and training with gradient descent. All of this was done without relying on high-level machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how neural networks function internally by manually implementing core components.

## Key Features

### Customizable Neural Network

1. Supports user-defined input size, number of hidden layers, hidden layer size, learning rate, and epochs.
2. Interactive user input for network parameters and training data.
3. Custom implementation of forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

### Object-Oriented Implementation

1. Encapsulation of neurons and network using classes.
2. Neuron class includes a `__call__` method for improved readability and scalability.
3. Modular design, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

### Interactive Training and Evaluation

1. Allows users to input their own training data via console input.
2. Provides real-time feedback on loss reduction over epochs (every 100).
3. Supports testing with custom input data after training completion.

## Project Structure

This project is modularized into different files to make the project directory more clear.

## Execution of Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
